[//]: # (Short description)

**The first multi-threaded asynchronous project.**

The goal of this project is to implement the functionality of the “F9 key”,
that is, a word hint on the entered letters. This project fulfills its direct
responsibility - not as well as large companies offer, because it searches for
words directly, and not through some special algorithms (which help to increase
the correctness of the proposed words).
